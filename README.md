# Python_ML_Dev

The ML models are uploaded as scripts, with the whole process, my thoughts etc.

Run all to run the scripts, I have changed the values for the GridSearch to higher values,
to ensure the model doesnt take too long to run. These values can be changed as required.

The files are split into coffee and Sugar scripts.

The dummy data is stored as csv, once again split up. It is the same dates over the same value range
as those in the examples given.

I have treated the data as a static object, so the majority of the code is coded for the data given,
and will throw errors if there are big changes to the dataset.
