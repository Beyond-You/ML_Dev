# Python_ML_Dev

The ML models are uploaded as scripts, with the whole process, my thoughts etc.

Run all to run the scripts, I have changed the values for the GridSearch to higher values,
to ensure the model doesnt take too long to run. These values can be changed as required.

The files are split into coffee and Sugar scripts.

The dummy data is stored as csv, once again split up. It is the same dates over the same value range
as those in the examples given.

I have treated the data as a static object, so the majority of the code is coded for the data given,
and will produce errors if there are big changes to the dataset.
 
You will need to add an API key in to retrieve the latest data, or you can use the csv files provided and read
those in. That is data that was obtained on 2023-05-07.
